# A Nerds Dating App

A place where nerds can find their true love, or find a new person to play games with online.

## Description

Users can sign up and register and match with other users with similar gaming interests. There is an option to share location to filter out for users near their location. Once an user matches with another user, they have the ability to chat real-time with another user. Stores all of the matches, and chat logs inside the database to continue chatting or matching with other users. Uses express for the back-end, postgres for the database, and react for the front end.
